# area-calculations-

- Create a new Python file in this folder called task2.py.
-	This program will be used to calculate the area that the foundation of a building covers. This program should:
-	Ask the user to enter the shape of the building (square, rectangular or round).
- Based on the user‚Äôs input, prompt for the appropriate dimensions.
See what dimensions you need in the list of formulae below.
- Calculate and display the area that will be taken up by the foundation of the building.

-	Formulae for area:
-	Area of square = length of the square to the power of two (length2).
- Area of rectangle = length x width.
- Area of circle = pi x radius squared (ùõ±radius2).
